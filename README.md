1. Install VPython please!
In case you are using Anaconda (Windows) (which you OF COURSE are), run cmd as administrator and enter: conda install -c mwcraig vpython

2. On the fortran files, code is compiled with f2py into .so files, they can be imported in python. To acces documentation print (in python) use the __doc__ function on the module or the subroutines in the module.

Happy downloading!
